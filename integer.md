Integers can be either signed or unsigned.
- Signed integers: *positive, negative, zero*
- Unsigned integers: *positive, zero*

`Int` is a *Signed integer* value type.\
`UInt` is an *Unsigned integer* value type.

> Int and UInt has the same size as the current platformâ€™s native word size.
> - On a 32-bit platform, Int/UInt is the same size as Int32.
> - On a 64-bit platform, Int/UInt is the same size as Int64.
>
> callout: Int is preferred over UInt.
