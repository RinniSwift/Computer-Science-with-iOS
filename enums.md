# Enums

enumeration defines a common type for a group of related values and enables you to work with those values in a type-safe way within your code.
There're C enumerations but they're defined by integer values.
Enums in Swift are much more flexible, and donâ€™t have to provide a value for each case of the enumeration. If a value (known as a raw value) is provided for each enumeration case, the value can be a string, a character, or a value of any integer or floating-point type.

### Switch statements

enums support switch statements for matching enumeration values.

```swift
enum Filter {
    case openNow
    case discounted
}
```

```swift
let selectedFilter = Filter.openNow
switch selectedFilter {
case .openNow:
    print("open now")
case .discounted:
    print("discounted")
}
```

You must provide a case in the switch statement to not ommit any enum cases. This is because switch statements on enums must be exhaustive.

```swift
switch selectedFilter {
case .openNow:
    print("open now")
default:
    print("other case/s")
}
```

**Switch Statement**

`default` covers cases that aren't addressed explicitly.

switch statements compares one or more values in the same line: `case .openNow, .discounted`

switch statements in swift are not fallthrough by default unlike objective-c where you'd need an explicit `break` statement to not fallthrough to the next case. To make switch cases fallthrough, use the `fallthrough` statement.

### Iterating enum cases

In order to make the cases within the enum iterable, you must conform the enum to `CaseIterable`. This gives the enum an additive property of `allCases` which returns an array of the cases in sorted order from the enum definition.

```swift
enum Filter: CaseIterable {
    case openNow
    case discounted
}
```

Calling `Filter.allCases` will return 

```swift
[Fiter.openNow, Filter.ascendingPrice, Filter.descendingPrice, Filter.discounted]
```

Now if you were to have associated values for a case in your enum, you would have to define the `allCases` property yourself.

```swift
enum Filter: CaseIterable {
    case openNow
    case discounted
    case distance(miles: UInt)

    static var allCases: [Filter] {
        return [.openNow, .discounted, .distance(miles: 7)]
    }
}
```

Because enums can't know the value of the associated type, it can't infer the all cases. You must define it yourself.

### Decoding enums
*From JSON responses*

When decoding JSON responses, you have to keep in mind that decoding can fail, or even crash the app if not handled well. Some of this comes from change in JSON formatting, or modified values in parameters. I ran into this recently where we created decoded a field in the JSON response into an enum but weren't aware of future additions to the enum made from server. So the decoding would fail and crash the app. Since we were decoding the value at the field directly into an enum, there lies the problem if there were to be additions.

A way to handle this is to modify the enum into a `String` type, and then initialize the enum from the raw representable string. This is assuming that the enum conforms to `String` type. Like below:

```swift
enum SomeRating: String {
    case high
    case medium
    case low
    case unknown
}
```

```swift
// ...

init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
    let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
    let someRatingStr = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .someRating)
    let someRating = SomeRating(rawValue: someRatingStr) ?? .unknown
}
```
