# Optionals

Declares operations that may or may not return a value.\
Swift handle it's optionals with enums. As well as including 'associated values'. These are values that can also have another value associated with them.

```Swift
public enum Optional<Wrapped>: ExpressibleByNilLiteral {
   case none
   case some(Wrapped)
}
```

Optionals conform to the ExpressibleByNilLiteral so that you can write nil instead of ```.none```\
Even if we never write the word 'Optional', when we create     ```Int?``` it is equivalent to writing ```Optional<Int>```. You must unwrap optional values before using them and there are many ways to. We use these for "failable" values:

- *if let*
- *if var*
- *while let*
- *while var*
- *Doubly nested optionals*
- *Optional chaining*
- *nil-Coalescing operator*

### if let
Optional binding is similar to the switch statement.\
**if var**\
If wanting to make changes to the optional value. The one copied will not affect the value inside the original copy. *Optional are value types, and unwrapping them unwraps the value inside.*

```swift
var array = ["r", "i", "n"]
if let index = array.index(of: "i") {
   array.remove(at: index)
}

let number = "1"
if var i = Int(number) {
   i += 1
   print(i)
}
// 2
```
You can also bind other entries in the same if statement.

### while let
Similar to the if let. This is a loop that only terminates when a nil is returned. This is useful for the readline() function which will return nil once it hits the last line or even until the string has a nil value when mutating it.\
**while var**\
Making changes to an optional value but the value will not change the original one.

```swift
while let line = readline() {
   print(line)
}
```

### doubly nested optionals
The type the optional wraps can itself be an optional, which leads to optionals nested inside optionals. 

```swift
let stringNumbers = ["1", "2", "three"]
let maybeInts = stringNumbers.map{ Int($0) }
```
When looping over the ```maybeInts```, the array is an optional array of ints and the item is also an optional. Making the next value of each iteration a Int?? or Optional<Optional<Int>>. There are 2 other functions that either loops over non-nil values or nil values using the ```for case in```.

```swift
for case let i? in maybeInts {
   print(i, terminator: " ")
}
// 1 2

for case nil in maybeInts {
   print("no value")
}
// no value
```

### Optional chaining
You can chain calls on optional values as such:

```swift
let result = str?.uppercased()
let resultLower = str?.uppercased().lowercased()
```
The reason why we didn't need the```?``` after the ```uppercased()``` is becasue optional chaining is a *"flattening"* operation. ```str?.uppercased()``` returned an optional so if you wrote ```str?.uppercased()?.lowercased()```, this would get you an optional optional. So we just write the second chain without an optional to represent that the optionality is already captured. But! If the ```uppercased()``` returned an optional, then your need the ```?``` to express that you were chaining *that* optional. e.g.:

```swift
extension Int {
   var half: Int? {
       guard self > 1 else { return nil }
       return self / 2
   }
}

20.half?.half?.half // Optional(2)
```
Optional chaining can be used instead of ```if let``` as well.

```swift
let splitViewController: UISplitViewController? = nil
let myDelegate: UISplitViewControllerDelegate? = nil
if let viewController = splitViewController {
   viewController.delegate = myDelegate
}

// using optional chaining works as well:
splitViewController?.delegate = myDelegate
```

### nil-Coalescing operator
Use this when you want to unwrap an optional and replacing nil with some default value.\
Some use cases would be if you want to access the first value in an array, but in the case that it's empty, you want to provide a deafault.

```swift
let stringInt = "1"
let number = Int(stringInt) ?? 0

let array = [1, 2, 3]
array.first ?? 0    // 1
// Or
// 2.
!array.isEmpty ? array[0] : 0    // 1. is better than 2.

array.count > 5 ? array[5] : 0    // 0
```
The ```??``` signals that this is a default value. In the ```2.```, it awkwardly starts first with the check, then the value, then the default. Where as the first choice we put the default in the middle and the value at the end.\
nil-Coalescing can also be chained.

```swift
let i: Int? = nil
let j: Int? = nil
let k: Int? = 22

i ?? j ?? k    // Optional(2)
```
This *nil-Coalescing chaining returns the first value that is non-nil*\
You can think of this as similar to the "or" statement where if one value is non-nil, it returns that. And also can think of the "if let" as an "and" statement. Where when you chain if let entries, they all must be non-nil.
